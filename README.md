# SpiceworksAutoAssign

SAP Spiceworks Helpdesk is a popular IT service management (ITSM) tool that helps organizations manage their support tickets. However, manually classifying and assigning tickets can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

This project aims to use ML and NLP to automate the classification and assignment of SAP Spiceworks Helpdesk tickets. By training a ML model on a dataset of historical tickets, the model can learn to identify the module of a ticket and the most appropriate PIC.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify and assign new tickets automatically. This can free up support staff to focus on more complex issues and improve the accuracy of ticket routing.

Benefits:
* Improved efficiency and effectiveness of SAP Spiceworks Helpdesk support
* Reduced workload for support staff
* Faster resolution times for tickets
* Improved accuracy of ticket routing

## Potential Applications

This project could be used in a variety of organizations, including:
* IT departments
* Customer service centers
* Help desks
* Technical support teams

## Conclusion

This project has the potential to significantly improve the way that SAP Spiceworks Helpdesk tickets are classified and assigned. By automating and improving this process, organizations can free up support staff, improve the accuracy of ticket routing, and reduce the resolution time for tickets.
